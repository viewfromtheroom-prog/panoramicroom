    <h1>Panoramic Room: What It Means, How It Differs, and How to Verify the View</h1>
    <p class="sub">A practical guide to the hotel meaning of “panoramic room” — plus the fastest way to confirm the actual view before you book.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section class="card" aria-label="Quick definition">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0;">What is a panoramic room?</h2>
      <p><strong>A panoramic room</strong> is a hotel room promoted for a <strong>wide, expansive view</strong> of the surrounding scenery—city, ocean, harbour, mountains, landmarks—often enabled by <strong>large windows</strong>, <strong>corner layouts</strong>, or <strong>higher floors</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> In hotels, “panoramic room” refers to the <strong>view from the room</strong>, not the physical size of the room.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why “panoramic room” can be confusing</h2>
      <p>Hotels don’t use “panoramic” in one universal way. In many properties, the biggest difference is simply a better <strong>view</strong>—sometimes because the room is on a higher floor. (For example, some hotels describe panoramic rooms as being on higher floors to maximise views.)</p>
      <p>That’s why travellers often ask: <em>“Is it actually different from a standard room, or just marketing?”</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Panoramic room vs standard room</h2>
      <p>A panoramic room differs from a standard room primarily in the <strong>view</strong>. Size and layout may or may not change.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Panoramic Room</th><th>Standard Room</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>View</td><td>Marketed as wide / expansive</td><td>No view guarantee</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Floor level</td><td>Often higher floors</td><td>Any floor</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Windows</td><td>Often larger or better-positioned</td><td>Standard</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Price</td><td>Usually higher</td><td>Usually lower</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is a panoramic room worth it?</h2>
      <p>It’s usually worth paying extra if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The view is a key part of your trip (special occasion, iconic destination, sunset/night skyline).</li>
        <li>You’ll spend meaningful time in the room during daylight or evening.</li>
        <li>The view is genuinely unobstructed (not angled, distant, or blocked).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It may <strong>not</strong> be worth it if the ocean/city is only visible at an angle, the view is far away, or nearby buildings block the outlook.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The best way to verify a panoramic room view</h2>
      <p>Marketing photos can be beautiful—but they don’t always show the real angle, obstructions, height, or how the view looks at night.</p>
      <p><strong>Best practice:</strong> check <strong>real guest-submitted photos</strong> of the specific room category.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What does “panoramic room” mean?</h3>
      <p>In hotels, it typically means a room sold for its wide view—often via larger windows, corner layouts, or higher floors.</p>

      <h3>Does “panoramic room” always mean ocean view?</h3>
      <p>No. Panoramic rooms can face city skylines, harbours, mountains, landmarks, or open landscapes.</p>

      <h3>Is panoramic the same as “high floor”?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes. Some hotels use “panoramic” mainly to indicate a higher floor with a better view, even if the room layout is similar.</p>

      <h3>How do I avoid booking a “panoramic” room with a disappointing view?</h3>
      <p>Look for real guest photos of that room category. This confirms the angle, height, and whether anything blocks the view.</p>
